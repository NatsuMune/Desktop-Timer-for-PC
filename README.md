# LeetCode 45-Minute Timer

A simple, modern Windows application to help you follow the 45-minute rule when solving LeetCode problems. This timer helps you manage your problem-solving sessions effectively by breaking them down into three phases:

1. **Problem Solving (25 minutes)**
   - Attempt to solve the problem on your own
   - Focus on understanding and implementing a solution

2. **Hint Review (5 minutes)**
   - If stuck, review available hints
   - Consider different approaches

3. **Solution Study (15 minutes)**
   - If still unable to solve, study the solution
   - Understand the optimal approach and implementation

## Features

- üïí Automatic phase transitions with audio alerts
- üìå Always-on-top window for easy visibility
